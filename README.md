Project Description  
This project is an experimental John Wick–inspired first-person shooter developed in Unity with a strong focus on core gameplay mechanics rather than visuals. 
At its current stage, the project does not use any external assets or third-party models. All characters, weapons, and environments are built using Unity’s default primitive meshes, allowing full concentration on systems such as:  
Player movement and responsiveness 
Gunplay and hit-scan mechanics 
Enemy AI behavior and combat logic 
State-driven decision making 
Combat flow inspired by fast, tactical 
FPS design 
The primary goal of this project is to deeply understand FPS architecture, clean code structure, and scalable gameplay systems before moving into visual polish or asset integration. 
This repository represents an early but solid foundation for a high-intensity, cinematic shooter experience, and will continue to evolve as mechanics are refined and expanded.
